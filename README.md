# Xetch - MiBand 7 watch face

This watch face encompasses elegance and minimalistic approach, leaving on your watch only really important info. 

## Building

I use [zmake](https://github.com/melianmiko/zmake) for building, so it's the following:

```bash
cd xetch
zmake .
```

Then you can copy `dist/xetch.bin` to your watch and enjoy.

## Media

### Default screen

### Disconnected

### Battery percentage

To switch between this and default screens, you need to tap on the date area. Additionally, after 10 seconds, it will return back to showing date for convenience.
